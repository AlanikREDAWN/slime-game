This Game was made for Hack Clubâ€™s [Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade/) Game Jam. The theme was loopholes, so I decided to incorporate hidden loopholes required to beat the levels into the game. You can find my submission in [this](https://github.com/hackclub/Arcade-Game-Jam/tree/main/submissions/SIime%20Game%20-%20Lilia%20Dostie%20(KittyCat)) GitHub repo.
